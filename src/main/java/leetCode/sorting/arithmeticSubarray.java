public class arithmeticSubarray {
    /*
    A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every
    two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.

    For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
    1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    7, 7, 7, 7
    3, -1, -5, -9

    The following sequence is not arithmetic:
    1, 1, 2, 5, 7
    You are given an array of n integers, nums, and two arrays of m integers each, l and r, representing the m range
    queries, where the ith query is the range [l[i], r[i]]. All the arrays are 0-indexed.

    Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the subarray nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... ,
    nums[r[i]] can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [4,6,5,9,3,7], l = [0,0,2], r = [2,3,5]
    Output: [true,false,true]
    Explanation:
    In the 0th query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.
    In the 1st query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.
    In the 2nd query, the subarray is [5,9,3,7]. This can be rearranged as [3,5,7,9], which is an arithmetic sequence.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [-12,-9,-3,-12,-6,15,20,-25,-20,-15,-10], l = [0,1,6,4,8,7], r = [4,4,9,7,9,10]
    Output: [false,true,false,false,true,true]

    Constraints:
        n == nums.length
        m == l.length
        m == r.length
        2 <= n <= 500
        1 <= m <= 500
        0 <= l[i] < r[i] < n
        -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
