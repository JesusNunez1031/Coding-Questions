    /*
    You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all
    the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

    The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not
    exist, output -1 for this number.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
    Output: [-1,3,-1]
    Explanation:
        For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
        For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
        For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
    Output: [3,-1]
    Explanation:
        For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
        For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

    Note:
        All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
        The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.
