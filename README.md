# Coding-Questions
Collection of coding questions taken from Cracking the coding interview book, LeetCode, HackerRank, and other sources. All questions are solved using Java language. **Directories are named after the source of the question so all leetcode questions I have done can be found in said directory.** 

Daily updates will be added as I continue to solve more from leetcode and HackerRank. Comments will also be added eventually for others trying to understand files. I try to come up or find the easiest solutions to problems to ensure the comprehension of the code is clear. I like to believe that if a question is giving you a rough time, its ok to see a good solution and learn from it.

# Future Additions
As soon as I complete all questions foud in CodingBat.com I will also add them to this repo.

###### Contribibutions
Feel free to request new questions or comment on the code currently available. Also feel free to check out my Algorithms and data-structrues repo for help implementing specific data structures; more will be added as I continue to study topics.
