# Coding-Questions
Collection of coding questions taken from Cracking the coding interview book, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) and other sources. All questions are solved using Java language. **Directories are named after the source of the question so all leetcode questions I have done can be found in said directory.** 

Daily updates will be added as I continue to solve more from leetcode and HackerRank. Comments will also be added eventually for others trying to understand files. I try to come up or find the easiest solutions to problems to ensure the comprehension of the code is clear. I like to believe that if a question is giving you a rough time, it's ok to see a good solution and learn from it rather than making it more complex.

# Future Additions
Questions found on [CodingBat.com](https://codingbat.com/) will also be added to this repo. These include String, Arrays, Logic, HashMap, and recursion questions. Python questions found on the site will also be added.

###### Contributions
Feel free to request new questions or comment on the code currently available. Also, check out my Algorithms and data-structures repo for help on implementing specific data structures; more will be added as I continue to study topics.
