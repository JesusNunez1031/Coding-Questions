# Coding-Questions
Collection of coding questions taken from Cracking the coding interview book, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), [CodingBat.com](https://codingbat.com/) and other sources. All questions are solved using Java language. **Directories are named after the source of the question so all leetcode questions I have done can be found in said directory. Questions are also organized by topics** 

Daily updates will be added as I continue to solve more from leetcode and HackerRank. Complex questions include comments to help understand approach. I try to come up or find the easiest solutions to problems to ensure the comprehension of the code is clear. I like to believe that if a question is giving you a rough time, it's ok to see a good solution and learn from it rather than making it more complex.

Feel free to make pull request's to add comments or fix issues on the code currently available. Also, check out my Algorithms and data-structures repo for help on implementing specific data structures; more will be added as I continue to study topics.
