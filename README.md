# Coding-Questions
Collection of coding questions taken from Cracking the coding interview book, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), [CodingBat.com](https://codingbat.com/) and other sources. All questions are solved using Java language. **Directories are named after the source of the question so all leetcode questions I have done can be found in said directory. Questions are also organized by topics** 

Daily updates will be added as I continue to solve more from leetcode and HackerRank. Complex questions include comments to help understand approach. I try to come up or find the easiest solutions to problems to ensure the comprehension of the code is clear. I like to believe that if a question is giving you a rough time, it's ok to see a good solution and learn from it rather than making it more complex.
### Essential Data Structures
1. Primitive Arrays
2. 2-D Arrays
3. Lists (e.g. Linked Lists, Array Lists)
4. Stacks
5. Queues, Deque, Priority Queues
6. Maps (e.g. Sets, Hash Maps)
7. Binary Trees
### Tips For Approaches to Algorithm Questions
1. If the given array is sorted consider using,
   - Binary Search
   - Two Pointers
2. If asked to give all permutations/subsets for a given set of data,
   - Backtracking
   - Sorting given data can help reduce extra work
3. If given a Tree or Graph,
   - DFS (Depth First Search)
   - BFS (Breath First Search)
4. If given a linked list,
   - Two Pointers
5. If recursion is not allowed, a stack is equivalent to the recursion stack used by the compiler
6. If you're not allowed to use other data structures and must solve in-place consider,
   - swapping values
   - store one or more different values in the same pointer
7. If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subsest/options,
   - Dynamic Programming 
8. If asked for top/least K items, 
   - Heaps (e.g. Priority Queues)
9. If asked for common strings, string prefixes, etc.
   - Map
   - Trie
10. If asked for prefix sums
    - Binary Indexed Trees
11. If multiplication, addition, division, subtraction are not allowed
    - Bitwise operators

Feel free to make pull request's to add comments or suggest improvements on the code currently available. Also, check out my Algorithms and data-structures repo for help on implementing specific data structures; more will be added as I continue to study topics.
